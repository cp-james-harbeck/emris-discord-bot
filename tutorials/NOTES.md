// In handcashserver.js, you're currently hardcoding the app ID and app secret. It would be better to store these values in a separate configuration file and load them from there instead. This makes it easier to change these values in the future and keeps sensitive information out of the main code.

// You're defining the updateUserPaymentStatus and getUserAuthToken functions inside the handcashserver.js file, but these functions are also used in dalle.js. It would be better to move them to a separate module and import them into both files.

// In dalle.js, you're calling getUserPaymentStatus which is not defined in the code you provided. You probably meant to call updateUserPaymentStatus instead.

// In handlePayment function in dalle.js, you're hardcoding the payment amount to 0.001 BSV. It would be better to allow the user to specify the amount they want to pay.

// In handlePayment function, you're setting the payment status to "PENDING" before making the payment request. It would be better to set the status to "PENDING" after the payment request has been created and before redirecting the user to the payment page. Otherwise, the payment status will be set to "PENDING" even if the payment request fails.

// In dalle.js, you're not handling errors that occur when calling updateTotalCost and getImageResponse functions. It's a good practice to always handle errors to prevent your code from crashing.

// In dalle.js, you're not checking if the user has already paid before allowing them to regenerate the image. It would be better to check the payment status before allowing them to regenerate the image.

// In dalle.js, you're not checking if the payment request was successful before setting the payment status to "PAID". It would be better to check the payment status after the payment has been made and update the status accordingly.

// In dalle.js, you're hardcoding the payment amount to a fixed value. It would be better to allow the user to specify the amount they want to pay.

// In dalle.js, you're hardcoding the payment currency to BSV. It would be better to allow the user to choose the currency they want to pay with.

// In dalle.js, you're hardcoding the product name and description. It would be better to allow the user to specify these values.
